### Tech Tools

- Sonic Pi IDE
- Google Slides / Peardeck
- Google Docs / Google Classroom
- Random Dice Rolls website / Random Coin Flip Website

**Sonic Pi IDE**<br>
This is the programming environment for Sonic Pi. It is where you write Sonic Pi code and run it which includes the SuperCollider engine which produces the audible output of your code. This is where all the code for the projects will be done for this unit. This is basically the only environment that can run Sonic Pi and produce the musical output all in the same place.

**Google Slides / Peardeck**<br>
This is used for interactive slide presentations where students can answers questions on a slide. This will be used for one or two lessons where students need to analyze small code examples and explain what the code is doing and/or make predictions about what the code will do. It is a helpful way to have students submit responses where I can see their answers in real time and use it to assess understanding and possible misconceptions.

**Google Docs / Google Classroom**
This is where students can submit larger assignments and I can provide grades and feedback. The students will be submitting their final project by copying and pasting their Sonic Pi code into a Google doc. They will also have to use the comment feature in Google docs to explain specific parts of their code. I like using theis format because it is an easy way for students to provide explanations about how their code works by highlighting specific lines and commenting on them. it also allows me the ability to provide feedback in response to the comments they have left and I can highlight other parts of code and leave specific feedback.

**[Random Dice Rolls website](https://www.random.org/dice/?num=1) / [Random Coin Flip Website](https://flipsimu.com)**
These websites simulate the random acts of flipping a coin and rolling a die. One of the first assignments is to create a composition where note and rhythm values are chosen through indeterminate acts like a coin flip and dice roll. They will then have to write a program to simulate these indeterminate acts. While I would like to have them use actual coins and dice, I thought it would also be interesting to see it in a simulation to give some perspective on how simulations can be made. The dice website also mention that it is "true random" and this would be a good lead in to my lesson where we differentiate between true random and pseudorandom.
