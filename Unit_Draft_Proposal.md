# Unit Draft Proposal
## Sonic Pi: Generative Music


### Description:
This unit would start by exploring methods of using randomization in code to produce different output in the form of generative music. Students would first learn some basic ways to create random output within the context of a Sonic Pi program. From there, they would use these methods to create a larger scale composition of music which can utilize these methods to generate a unique piece of music which evolves over time based on randomized input.

After completing this part of the unit, we would use this composing experience as a springboard into a broader discussion on topics related to generative music. This would include first examining the idea of originality, creativity and agency within the context of generative music, addressing such questions as if the program itself is producing creative pieces of work each time even though it is running the same code (which could address how input can affect output).

We would then look at real world examples of how AI is used to generate music in the real world. This would involve a brief introduction to how AI works (using collections of data to train a ML model and then producing an output based on that training data). Students would have the opportunity to explore some online projects which use AI to generate music ([Bach Google Doodle](https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-johann-sebastian-bach), [Neural Drum Machine](https://codepen.io/teropa/full/JLjXGK), [GrooVAE](https://groove-drums.glitch.me/), [AI Duet](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/ai-duet), etc) just to familiarize themselves with how these models can work. We would use this to open up discussions about whether making music in this way can be considered authentic “art” since it removes some human creative decision making, what is data bias and how it can influence the output, how curation of output can create an inaccurate representation of what a model is capable of. I would anticipate using a Socratic Seminar discussion format to explore these topics.

We would also examine some proprietary models used to generate music ([Endel](https://endel.io/), [AIVA](https://www.aiva.ai/), [The Trap Factory](https://www.aiva.ai/)) and discuss some ethical issues involved including methods of data collection and automating the creative process.

The culmination of this unit would be for students to create a podcast in which they choose one topic of their choice discussed in this unit or relevant to what was covered in the unit and present information about the topic as well as examining potential issues that exist and exploring the pros and cons of their topic.

### Rationale:

This would be an opportunity for students to learn how to use multiple methods on randomization in code to create a generative system which can create an ever changing stream of output. It also fits together several different concepts we would have learned, so it is a chance to synthesize their knowledge to produce a more complex program.

I want to make a unit that is not just coding but has a chance to explore some other CS topics beyond programming and address some different standards. This unit would present opportunities to incorporate some discussions about how AI works in relation to making creative output and some ethical issues that can arise when doing this. Since AI is becoming a more common placed thing in society, I think it is important for students to acquire some understanding of what it is and how it works. This could very well be some students first exposure to how AI works and I think using art and music as an entry point can be a very effective way to get the students interested in the topic.


### Placement:

I feel that this would be something which would come up in the second half of the year, most likely as the final unit of the third semester. I would definitely want students to already have a strong foundation of the basics in Sonic Pi as well as experience using some common CS concepts like linear data structures (arrays, rings), conditional statements, loops. I think this would be a good way for them to utilize that knowledge while introducing them to a new concept like randomization which all can be used in a creative way. I also think culminating this unit with some type of non-coding project would provide a good break in the amount of coding students would have done up to this point and hopefully refresh them so they can finish out the rest of the course strong as well as provide some additional perspective in their CS education.
