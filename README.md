# Sonic Pi Generative Music Unit Plan
**by Liam Baum**

-----

## General Overview

#### Description<br>
This unit explores methods of using randomization in code to produce different output in the form of generative music. Students first learn some basic ways to create random output within the context of a Sonic Pi program. From there, they use these methods to create a larger scale composition of music which can utilize these methods to generate a unique piece of music which evolves over time based on randomized input.

#### What class
This would be part of a class which teaches basic programming concepts exclusively through using Sonic Pi. This class could be a intro course for students who have little to no programming experience. It could also be an elective for students who have coding experience in a different language and have some interest in music.

#### When
I feel that this would be something which would come up in the second half of the year. I would definitely want students to already have a strong foundation of the basics in Sonic Pi as well as experience using some common CS concepts like linear data structures (arrays, rings), conditional statements, loops. I think this would be a good way for them to utilize that knowledge while introducing them to a new concept like randomization which all can be used in a creative way.

## Motivation for Unit
I wanted to make a unit that would be something I could use in the future. I have taught several of the concepts that would be used in this Unit, but this would provide some sort of cohesive way to apply them all in a creative way beyond just short assignments to demonstrate understanding of the concepts.<br>
